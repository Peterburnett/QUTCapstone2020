// To Do List
 - course_settings.php, implement is_cancelled, needs to change the displayed course price back to what it actually is.
 - Implement sending messages to user and/or admin when purchase error is detected. Currently is only a paypal function, where it should be done on the manager layer.
 - Add checks to ensure a user cannot just set the course id in the url and purchase it. They must go through the proper route.
